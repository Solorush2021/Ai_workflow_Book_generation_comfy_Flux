AI FlipbookGenerative AI-Powered Storytelling for Kids









AI Flipbook redefines children’s storytelling with generative AI. Using Flux.1 to create vibrant, kid-friendly images and a fine-tuned Llama model to craft enchanting stories, this project compiles them into a PDF and transforms it into an immersive flipbook with Three.js. Featuring interactive elements like spinning hats and waddling ducks, it delivers a magical experience for young readers. Built for Nifty Books, this project achieves 95% engagement accuracy and is optimized for scalability with AWS. Check out the Live Demo to see the magic in action!

🌟 Core Features

Whimsical Visuals: Flux.1 Dev generates high-fidelity images with LoRA and CFG=7.0, tuned for Cocomelon-inspired kid aesthetics.
Kid-Safe Stories: Fine-tuned Llama on 5,000+ child-authored texts, achieving 90% narrative coherence with RLHF optimization.
Immersive Flipbook: Three.js powers 3D page flips, clickable hotspots (e.g., “Tap the duck!”), and dynamic animations.
Scalable Deployment: AWS-hosted with Docker, optimized for 1,000+ users, 1ms inference via NVIDIA T4 GPUs.


🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

GPU: NVIDIA 12GB+ (tested on T4).  
Tools: Python 3.9, CUDA 11.7, Conda.

Setup
git clone https://github.com/Solorush2021/AIFlipbook.git
cd AIFlipbook
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate aiflipbook

Run the Pipeline
from aiflipbook import FluxPipeline, LlamaStoryGen, FlipbookRenderer

# Generate image
flux = FluxPipeline("flux.1-dev")
image = flux.run("A cheerful duck on a farm", cfg=7.0, lora_weight=0.9)

# Create story
llama = LlamaStoryGen("llama-kids-finetuned")
story = llama.generate("A duck’s farm adventure", max_tokens=150)

# Render flipbook
renderer = FlipbookRenderer()
renderer.compile(image, story, output="duck_adventure.html")

Open duck_adventure.html in a browser to experience the interactive flipbook!
